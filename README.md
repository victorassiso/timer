# Pomodoro Timer App - React Project

A Pomodoro app designed to help users manage their work cycles efficiently. The app features a timer with a countdown display and maintains a history of "projects", representing cycles that the user has initiated. Users can start, interrupt, or allow a cycle to complete by waiting for the countdown to finish. Each cycle, or "project", can be customized with a name and a specified duration in minutes. The app includes a history page where users can review past projects, displaying details such as date and status (completed, interrupted, or in progress).
